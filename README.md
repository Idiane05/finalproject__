# Farmer Connect

***Project Overview***

Farmer Connect is a platform designed to bridge the gap between local farmers and customers. It provides an easy way for farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers, while customers can enjoy fresh, locally sourced products. The website features two main user roles: customers and farmers.
